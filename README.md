# C++ based Multi-Threading framework
This is a framework for Multi-Threading. 
## Idea
1. If you want to ```pthread_create()``` for each class object during run-time.
   -> ```handler()``` is a member function in class.
2. If you don't want to create another ```struct``` or ```class``` for each thread.
